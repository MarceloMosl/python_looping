## Part 1: Extracting the nth Digit from a Number

To extract the nth digit from a number using modulo (`%`) and integer division (`//`), these references explain the key concepts in detail:

- **[Extracting Digits from an Integer in Python: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://medium.com/@alopezmartinez/extracting-digits-from-an-integer-in-python-a-step-by-step-guide-96c9ff98db37)**  
  This article provides a comprehensive explanation of how to extract digits from an integer using arithmetic operations.

- **[Formatting a Number's Position with Proper Ending](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3644417/python-format-datetime-with-st-nd-rd-th-english-ordinal-suffix-like)**  
  This Stack Overflow post discusses how to add ordinal suffixes (e.g., `st`, `nd`, `rd`, `th`) to numbers, such as `1st`, `2nd`, etc.

## Part 2: Starry Pattern

No additional external documentation or online sources were used for this section. The solution was based on prior knowledge of loops and console rendering.

However, if you're interested in learning more about the relevant Python concepts, here are some useful links:

- **[Loops in Range](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_for_range.asp)**  
  This documentation explains the usage of `for` loops with the `range()` function in Python.

- **[Python Print Function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_print.asp)**  
  Learn how to use the `print()` function effectively, including customizing the output format.
